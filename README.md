# Chemical-Reaction-Predictor
A machine learning model that predicts the type of chemical reaction (such as synthesis, decomposition, displacement, or combustion) based on given reactants. Using a dataset of 1000+ reactions, the system learns reaction patterns and classifies new reactions accurately.
