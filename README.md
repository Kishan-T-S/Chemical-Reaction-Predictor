# Chemical-Reaction-Predictor
The Chemical Reaction Predictor is a machine learning project that can analyze a pair of chemical reactants and predict the most likely type of chemical reaction that will occur. Using a dataset of over 1000 reactions, the model learns patterns in reactants and products—such as decomposition, combustion, displacement, and acid–base behavior.

After training, the model can identify the reaction category for new, unseen combinations of chemicals. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in chemistry to automate reaction classification and support students, researchers, and beginners in understanding reaction behavior.
